FinalJavaScriptProject
======================
This is my final project for the first course at the Nashville Software School, Web Development Foundations.
The goal of the application is for users to find routes to other BCycle stations based on distance and elevation.
The user can select their origin station, then select how many miles they would like to ride. They are then presented
with a list of routes based on the distance they selected. The user can the view an elevation chart and map for each
route. 

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, and the GoogleMaps API.
